      ## Welcome to the Tina Starter.

      This project is set up to show you the basics of working with Tina. You're
      looking at the landing page, which pulls content from
      `content/pages/index.md`, components from `components/blocks` and
      `components/page`, and puts them all together in `pages/index.tsx`, all
      based on a schema defined in `.tina/schema.ts`.
