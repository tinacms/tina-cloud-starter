Editing content is one thing. Managing it across a team? That's a whole different challenge. When multiple people are contributing, it's easy to end up with conflicting changes, overwritten content, and general chaos.

TinaCloud solves this with a built-in **editorial workflow**, ensuring that:

* **Drafts, approvals, and reviews** are part of the process
* **Content is stored in GitHub**, keeping everything version-controlled
* **Collaboration is seamless**, even across teams

Instead of scattered docs and last-minute surprises, TinaCloud gives teams a clear structure for content creation and publishing. Whether you're a solo blogger or part of a larger editorial team, it helps keep everything running smoothly.
