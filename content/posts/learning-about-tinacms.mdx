Content management systems (CMSs) have long been clunky and disconnected. You write in one place, preview in another, and hope everything looks right when you publish. TinaCMS changes that.

With TinaCMS, you edit content directly on the page—just like a Google Doc, but for your website. Instead of jumping between an admin panel and your site, you make changes in real-time and see exactly how they’ll appear before hitting publish.

Why is this a game-changer?

- **Faster content updates** - No more switching tabs and refreshing.
- **More intuitive editing** - Non-technical users can update content without breaking things.
- **Built for modern development** - Works with Markdown, MDX, and headless CMS setups.

If you've ever been frustrated with traditional CMS workflows, TinaCMS is a breath of fresh air. Give it a try and see how much smoother content editing can be.
