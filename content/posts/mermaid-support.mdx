## Flowcharts

Use a flowchart to visualize processes, decision trees, or workflows. Itâ€™s ideal for simplifying complex systems or explaining logic visually.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A(Napoleon's Aspirations) --> B{Skills Needed?}
    B -->|"Nunchuck Skills"| C[Nunchucks Training]
    B -->|Computer Hacking Skills| D[Hacking Practice]
    B -->|Bow Hunting Skills| E[Archery Club]
    C --> F[Become a Martial Arts Master]
    D --> G[Create the Ultimate Chat Program]
    E --> H[Win a Hunting Trophy]
    F --> I{Impress Girls?}
    G --> I
    H --> I
    I -->|Yes| J[Date Deb]
    I -->|No| K[Draw Ligers]
    K --> L[Become Awesome Anyway]
```

## Sequence Diagram

Use a sequence diagram to illustrate interactions between components or systems over time, particularly for APIs, workflows, or system interactions.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Frodo
    participant Sam
    participant Ring
    Frodo->>Sam: "We need to destroy it."
    Sam->>Ring: Carries the burden
    Ring-->>Sam: "It's too heavy!"
    Sam-->>Frodo: "I can't carry it, but I can carry you!"
    Frodo-->>Ring: Throws it into Mount Doom
```

## Class Diagram

Use a class diagram for object-oriented system design, showing the structure of classes, attributes, and their relationships.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Jedi {
        +String name
        +String lightsaberColor
        +useForce()
    }
    class Sith {
        +String name
        +String lightsaberColor
        +useDarkSide()
    }
    Jedi <|-- Sith
```

## State Diagram

Use a state diagram to represent different states of a system or object and transitions between those states.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> TheShire
    TheShire --> Rivendell: Begin the journey
    Rivendell --> Moria: Pass through the mines
    Moria --> Gondor: Battle forces of evil
    Gondor --> Mordor: Approach Mount Doom
    Mordor --> [*]: Mission complete
```

## Entity Relationship Diagram

Use an ER diagram to model database structures, showing entities, attributes, and relationships.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    AVENGER ||--o{ MISSION : participates
    MISSION ||--|{ ENEMY : targets
    AVENGER {
        string name
        string superPower
    }
    MISSION {
        int id
        string location
    }
    ENEMY {
        string name
        string weakness
    }
```

## User Journey

Use a user journey diagram to track user interactions with your product or service and identify pain points or areas for improvement.

```mermaid
