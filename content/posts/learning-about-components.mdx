## Markdown, But Better

Hello, the current date is <DateTime format="local" />. Markdown is great for writing content, but what if you need something more interactive? What if you want to pull in dynamic data, display formatted callouts, or collect user input? That's where components come in.

```graphql
query MyQuery($relativePath: String!) {
  page(relativePath: $relativePath) {
    title
  }
}
```

> With components, your Markdown content isn't just static textâ€”it becomes a dynamic experience. You can fetch data, format content beautifully, and even build interactive elements directly inside your posts.

  Back in '82, I could code Markdown blindfolded. If I had these components back then, I'd be running the biggest blog on the internet, no doubt.
