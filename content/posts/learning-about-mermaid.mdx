## Flowcharts

Use a flowchart to visualize processes, decision trees, or workflows. It’s ideal for simplifying complex systems or explaining logic visually.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A(Napoleon's Aspirations) --> B{Skills Needed?}
    B -->|"Nunchuck Skills"| C[Nunchucks Training]
    B -->|Computer Hacking Skills| D[Hacking Practice]
    B -->|Bow Hunting Skills| E[Archery Club]
    C --> F[Become a Martial Arts Master]
    D --> G[Create the Ultimate Chat Program]
    E --> H[Win a Hunting Trophy]
    F --> I{Impress Girls?}
    G --> I
    H --> I
    I -->|Yes| J[Date Deb]
    I -->|No| K[Draw Ligers]
    K --> L[Become Awesome Anyway]
```

## Sequence Diagram

Use a sequence diagram to illustrate interactions between components or systems over time, particularly for APIs, workflows, or system interactions.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Frodo
    participant Sam
    participant Ring
    Frodo->>Sam: "We need to destroy it."
    Sam->>Ring: Carries the burden
    Ring-->>Sam: "It's too heavy!"
    Sam-->>Frodo: "I can't carry it, but I can carry you!"
    Frodo-->>Ring: Throws it into Mount Doom
```

## Class Diagram

Use a class diagram for object-oriented system design, showing the structure of classes, attributes, and their relationships.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Jedi {
        +String name
        +String lightsaberColor
        +useForce()
    }
    class Sith {
        +String name
        +String lightsaberColor
        +useDarkSide()
    }
    Jedi <|-- Sith
```

## State Diagram

Use a state diagram to represent different states of a system or object and transitions between those states.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> TheShire
    TheShire --> Rivendell: Begin the journey
    Rivendell --> Moria: Pass through the mines
    Moria --> Gondor: Battle forces of evil
    Gondor --> Mordor: Approach Mount Doom
    Mordor --> [*]: Mission complete
```

## Entity Relationship Diagram

Use an ER diagram to model database structures, showing entities, attributes, and relationships.

```mermaid
erDiagram
    AVENGER ||--o{ MISSION : participates
    MISSION ||--|{ ENEMY : targets
    AVENGER {
        string name
        string superPower
    }
    MISSION {
        int id
        string location
    }
    ENEMY {
        string name
        string weakness
    }
```

## User Journey

Use a user journey diagram to track user interactions with your product or service and identify pain points or areas for improvement.

```mermaid
journey
    title Star Wars User Journey
    section Discover
      Learn the Force: 5: Luke
      Train with Yoda: 4: Luke
    section Conflict
      Face Vader: 5: Luke
      Resist the Dark Side: 5: Luke
    section Triumph
      Redeem Vader: 4: Luke
      Save the Galaxy: 5: Luke
```

## Gantt Chart

Use a Gantt chart to visualize timelines and project schedules, tracking progress and dependencies.

```mermaid
gantt

    Install Laser Cannon :b2, 2025-04-01, 2025-06-30
```

## Pie Chart

Use a pie chart to represent data proportions visually, such as resource allocation or survey results.

```mermaid
pie
    title Avengers Assemble
    "Iron Man" : 25
    "Thor" : 20
    "Hulk" : 15
    "Captain America" : 30
    "Black Widow" : 10
```

## Quadrant Chart

Use a quadrant chart to prioritize tasks or visualize elements across two dimensions.

```mermaid
quadrantChart
    title Reach and engagement of campaigns
    x-axis Low Reach --> High Reach
    y-axis Low Engagement --> High Engagement
    quadrant-1 We should expand
    quadrant-2 Need to promote
    quadrant-3 Re-evaluate
    quadrant-4 May be improved
    Campaign A: [0.3, 0.6]
    Campaign B: [0.45, 0.23]
    Campaign C: [0.57, 0.69]
    Campaign D: [0.78, 0.34]
    Campaign E: [0.40, 0.34]
    Campaign F: [0.35, 0.78]
```

## Requirement Diagram

Use a requirement diagram to track project requirements and their relationships.

```mermaid
    requirementDiagram

    requirement test_req {
    id: 1
    text: the test text.
    risk: high
    verifymethod: test
    }

    element test_entity {
    type: simulation
    }

    test_entity - satisfies -> test_req
```

## Gitgraph (Git) Diagram

Use a Gitgraph diagram to visualize Git workflows and branching strategies.

```mermaid
gitGraph
    commit
    branch feature
    checkout feature
    commit
    branch hotfix
    checkout hotfix
    commit
    checkout main
    merge feature
    merge hotfix
```

## C4 Diagram

Use a C4 diagram for software architecture, showing system contexts, containers, components, and code.

```mermaid
    C4Context
      title System Context diagram for Internet Banking System
      Enterprise_Boundary(b0, "BankBoundary0") {
        Person(customerA, "Banking Customer A", "A customer of the bank, with personal bank accounts.")
        Person(customerB, "Banking Customer B")
        Person_Ext(customerC, "Banking Customer C", "desc")

        Person(customerD, "Banking Customer D", "A customer of the bank, <br/> with personal bank accounts.")

        System(SystemAA, "Internet Banking System", "Allows customers to view information about their bank accounts, and make payments.")

        Enterprise_Boundary(b1, "BankBoundary") {

          SystemDb_Ext(SystemE, "Mainframe Banking System", "Stores all of the core banking information about customers, accounts, transactions, etc.")

          System_Boundary(b2, "BankBoundary2") {
            System(SystemA, "Banking System A")
            System(SystemB, "Banking System B", "A system of the bank, with personal bank accounts. next line.")
          }

          System_Ext(SystemC, "E-mail system", "The internal Microsoft Exchange e-mail system.")
          SystemDb(SystemD, "Banking System D Database", "A system of the bank, with personal bank accounts.")

          Boundary(b3, "BankBoundary3", "boundary") {
            SystemQueue(SystemF, "Banking System F Queue", "A system of the bank.")
            SystemQueue_Ext(SystemG, "Banking System G Queue", "A system of the bank, with personal bank accounts.")
          }
        }
      }

      BiRel(customerA, SystemAA, "Uses")
      BiRel(SystemAA, SystemE, "Uses")
      Rel(SystemAA, SystemC, "Sends e-mails", "SMTP")
      Rel(SystemC, customerA, "Sends e-mails to")

      UpdateElementStyle(customerA, $fontColor="red", $bgColor="grey", $borderColor="red")
      UpdateRelStyle(customerA, SystemAA, $textColor="blue", $lineColor="blue", $offsetX="5")
      UpdateRelStyle(SystemAA, SystemE, $textColor="blue", $lineColor="blue", $offsetY="-10")
      UpdateRelStyle(SystemAA, SystemC, $textColor="blue", $lineColor="blue", $offsetY="-40", $offsetX="-50")
      UpdateRelStyle(SystemC, customerA, $textColor="red", $lineColor="red", $offsetX="-50", $offsetY="20")

      UpdateLayoutConfig($c4ShapeInRow="3", $c4BoundaryInRow="1")
```
