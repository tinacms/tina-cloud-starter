  Join me on my journey as I dive into the world of Markdown! In this post, I'll
  share what I've learned about using headers, emphasis, lists, images, links,
  blockquotes, inline code, syntax highlighting, tables, and even diagrams. It's
  a fun and powerful way to style text on the web, and I can't wait to show you
  what's possible.

Here's a demo of how everything looks.

The following markdown cheatsheet is adapted from: [https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

# What is Markdown?

Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

# Syntax guide

Here’s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com or in your own text files.

## Headers

```markdown
# This is a h1 tag

## This is a h2 tag

#### This is a h4 tag
```

# This is a h1 tag

## This is a h2 tag

#### This is a h4 tag

## Emphasis

```markdown
_This text will be italic_

**This text will be bold**

_You **can** combine them_
```

*This text will be italic*

**This text will be bold**

*You **can** combine them*

## Lists

### Unordered

```markdown
- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b
```

* Item 1
* Item 2
  * Item 2a
  * Item 2b

### Ordered

```markdown
1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b
```

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   2. Item 3b

## Images

```markdown
![A llama](/uploads/llama-6.avif)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)
```

![A llama](/uploads/llama-6.avif)

## Links

```markdown
http://tina.io - automatic!
[TinaCMS](http://tina.io)
```

[http://tina.io](http://tina.io) - automatic!

## Blockquotes

```markdown
As Napoleon said about the liger:

> It’s pretty much my favorite animal.
> It’s like a lion and a tiger mixed… bred for its skills in magic.
```

> It’s pretty much my favorite animal.
> It’s like a lion and a tiger mixed… bred for its skills in magic.

## Inline code

```markdown
I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
```

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.

## Syntax highlighting

Here’s an example of how you can use syntax highlighting with [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/):

````markdown
```js:fancyAlert.js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```
````

And here's how it looks - nicely colored with styled code titles!

```js:fancyAlert.js
function fancyAlert(arg) {
  if (arg) {
    $.facebox({ div: '#foo' })
  }
}
```

## Tables

You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens `-` (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe `|`:

```markdown
| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |
```

| First Header                | Second Header                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Content from cell 1         | Content from cell 2          |
| Content in the first column | Content in the second column |

## Diagrams

You can use Mermaid diagrams to visualize flows, sequences, and other chart types directly in Markdown. Here’s an example of a Mermaid flowchart:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Do Something]
    B -->|No| D[Do Something Else]
    C --> E[End]
    D --> E
```

Rendered, this would create a flowchart where decisions lead to different paths. Mermaid also supports sequence diagrams, Gantt charts, class diagrams, and more. For the full range of possibilities, check out the Mermaid documentation: [https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/)
