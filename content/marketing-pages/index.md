    messageHeader: Welcome to the Tina Cloud Starter
    messageBody: >
      The Tina Cloud project is an opinionated approach to working with the
      TinaCMS system that enables you to focus on building sites the way you're
      already used to. To that end, we've developed a GraphL API which allows
      you to define a schema for your filesystem. Once you've defined a schema,
      all you need to do is run a query against it, we'll look at that query and
      build your Tina forms for you automatically.


      We've given you a couple of files and a very basic schema to get you
      started. Check them out and have a read through the comments throughout
      the application files.


      For now we only support markdown files, but in the near future we'll open
      that up to whatever structured format you like!


      You're looking at the main landing page, it's a markdown file which you
      can find at "content/marketing-pages/index.md".


      This page is admittedly pretty boring, but what's neat about it is that
      you can actually edit the content right here from the context of your
      website. Click on the "Edit Page" tab in the top-right corner to get
      started!


      We've built a few pages for you to get started, take a look around and see
      if you can figure out how to build your own pages and templates.
