This Next.js starter is powered by [TinaCMS](https://tina.io) for you and your team to visually live edit content while browing the website. âœ¨  
The content is managed through text files stored in your GitHub repository, and queried through our Tina GraphQL API.

## Getting Started

### [Follow our starter guide to setup your site with TinaCMS](https://tina.io/guides/tina-cloud/starter/overview/)

### Overview

- Local Development workflow from the filesystem and a local GraqhQL server.
- [Tina headless backend](https://app.tina.io) to save changes back to GitHub and invite collaborators.
- Media management with [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com)
- Deploy on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to visually edit your site from `/admin` route.

## Requirements

- Git, [Node.js Active LTS](https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/), Yarn installed for local development
- A [TinaCMS](https://app.tina.io) account for live editing
- A [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com) account for media support

## Local development

Install the project's dependencies with

```

```

### URLs

- http://localhost:3000 : browse the website

### Typescript

A good way to ensure your components match the shape of your data is to leverage the auto-generated TypeScript types.
These are rebuilt when your `.tina` config changes.
